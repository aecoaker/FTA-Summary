  Article 4.4 
Regional Value Content 
 
1. Where  a regional value content requirement is specified in this Chapter, including 
related Annexes, to determine whether a good is originating, the regional value 
content shall be calculated using one of the following methods:  
 
Build -Down Method: based on the value of non- originating materials  
 
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =  𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣  𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑣𝑣 𝑔𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔 − 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛−𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑔𝑔 𝑚𝑚𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝑣𝑣𝑜𝑜
𝑜𝑜𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣  𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 
𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑣𝑣 𝑔𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔×100 
 Build -Up Method: based on the value of originating materials 
 
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =  𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣  𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑔𝑔 𝑚𝑚𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡𝑣𝑣𝑜𝑜
𝑜𝑜𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣  
𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑣𝑣 𝑔𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔×100 
 
in each case where:  
 RVC is the regional value content of a good, expressed as a percentage;  
 value of non -originating materials is the value of non- originating materials, 
including materials of undetermined origin, used in the production of the good; and  
 value of originating materials is the value of originating materials used in the 
production of the good in the territory of one or both Parties.  
 2.  All costs considered for the calculation of regional value content shall be recorded and maintained in conformity with the generally a ccepted accounting principles 
applicable in the territory of a Party where the good is produced. 
  
Article 4.5 
Materials Used in Production  
 1.  If a non- originating material undergoes further production such that it satisfies the 
requirements of this Chapter, the material shall be treated as originating when determining the originating  status of the subsequently produced good, regardless 
of wh ether that material was produced by the producer of the good. 
 2.  If a non- originating material is used in the production of a good, the following may 
be counted as originating content in determining whether the resulting good meets a regional value content requirement:  
 
(a) the value of production of the non- originating material undertaken in the 
territory of one or both Parties by one or more producers; and  
 
(b) the value of any originating material used in the production of the non-  
  originating material undertaken in the territory of one or both Parties by one 
or more producers. 
  
Article 4.6  
Value of Materials Used in Production  
   For the purposes of this Chapter, the value of a material is:  
 
(a) for a material imported by the producer of the good, the price actually paid 
or payable for the material at the time of importation or other value 
determined in accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement, including the costs incurred in the internatio nal shipment of the material; 
 
(b) for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced:  
 
(i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where the producer is located;  
 (ii) the value as determined for an imported material in sub paragraph 
(a); or  
 (iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; or  
 
(c) for a material that is self -produced: 
 
(i)  all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses; and  
 (ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self -produced material that is 
being valued. 
  
Article 4.7 
Further Adjustmen ts to the Value of Materials  
 1. For an originating material, the following expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 4.6 (Value of Materials Used in 
Production):   (a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred to transport the material to the location of the producer of the good;  
 
(b) duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the territory of a Party, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded,  
  refunda ble, or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or 
tax paid or payable; and  
 
(c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.  
 2.  For a non- originating material or material of undetermined origin, the following 
expenses may be deducted from the value of the material:   
 (a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer of the good;  
 
(b) duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and 
 
(c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product. 
 
3.  For greater certainty, when a non- originating material is used in the production of 
a good, the values referred to in subparagraph 2(a) and subparagraph 2(b) of Article 
4.5 (Materials Used in Production)  may be:  
 (a) deducted from the value of the non- originating material if calculating the 
regional value content requirement using the Build-Down Method; or  
 (b) included in the value of originating materials if calculating the regional value content requirement using t he Build -Up Method. 
 4.  For the purposes of this Article, if a cost, expense, or value is unknown or documentary evidence of the amount of the adjustment is not available, then no adjustment is allowed for that cost, expense, or value. 
  
Article 4.8  
Recovered Materials and Remanufactured Goods 
 1.  A recovered material derived in the territory of one or both of the Parties shall be treated as originating when it is used in the production of, and incorporated into, a remanufactured good.  
 2.  For greater certainty:  
 
(a) a remanufactured good shall be treated as originating only if it satisfies the applicable requirements of Article 4.2 (Origin Criteria); and  
  (b) a recovered material that is not used or incorporated in the production of a 
remanufactured good shall be treated as originating only if it satisfies the applicable requirements of Article 4.2 (Origin Criteria).  
  
Article 4.9  
Accumulation  
 
1.  A good shall be regarded as originating if the good is produced in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers, provided that the good satisfies the requirements of Article  4.2 (Origin Criteria) and all other applicable 
requirements in this Chapter. 
 2.  An o riginating good or material of one Party shall be considered originating in the 
territory of the other Party when used in the production of a good in the territory of the other Party. 
 3.  Production undertaken on a non -originating material in the territory of one or both 
Parties by one or more producers may contribute toward the originating content of a good for the purpose of determining its origin, regardless of whether that production was sufficient to confer originating status to the material itself.   
  
Article 4.10 
Tolerance  
 
1.  A good that contains non- originating materials that do not satisfy the applicable 
change in tariff classification requirement specified in Annex 4B (Product -Specific 
Rules) for the good shall nonetheless be regarded as originating if: 
 
(a) in the case of goods in Chapters 1 through 24 and 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System:  
 
(i) the total weight of those materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the good not including the weight of any packaging; or 
 (ii) the value of those materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good; or 
 
(b) in the case of goods in Chapters 25 through 49 and 64 through 97 of the Harmonized System, the value of those materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good, 
 
and the good meets all other applicable requirements of this Chapter.  
 
2.  If a good described in paragraph 1 is also subject to a regional value content 
requirement, the value of those non- originating materials shall be included in the  
  value of non- originating materials for any applicable regional value content 
requirement. 
 
 
Article 4.11 
Fungible Goods or Materials  
 
1.  A  fungible good or material shall be treated as originating based on the: 
  
(a) physical segregation of each fungible good or material; or  
 
(b) use of any inventory management method recognised in the generally accepted accounting p rinciples of the Party where the production is 
performed, if originating and non- originating fungible goods or materials 
are comingled, provided that the inventory management method selected is used throughout the fiscal year of the person that selected the inventory management method.   
2.  The inventory management system must ensure that no more goods or material receive originating status than would have been the case if the fungible goods or materials had been physically segregated.  
  
Article 4.12 
Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools, and Instructional or Other Information 
Materials  
 1.  For the purpose of determining origin of a good, accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or other information materials classified and delivered with, but not invoiced separately from a good shall be:  (a) disregarded in determining whether a good is wholly obtained or satisfies a process or c hange in tariff classification requirement set out in Annex 4B 
(Product-Specific Rules) for the good; and 
 
(b) taken into account as originating or non- originating materials, as the case 
may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good,  
 
provided the quantities, value, and type of accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or other information material are customary for the good.  
2.  Accessories, spare parts, tools, and instructional or other information materials, described in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to have the same originating status as the good with which they are delivered.  
  Article 4.13 
Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale  
 
Packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail 
sale shall, if classified with the good, be:  
 
(a) disregarded in determining whether the non- originating materials used in 
the production of the good have satisfied the applicable process or change 
in tariff classification requirement set out in Annex 4B (Product- Specific 
Rules), or whether the good is wholly obtained or produced; and 
 (b) taken into account as originating or non- originating materials, as the case 
may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good. 
  
Article 4.14 
Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment  
 
 Packing materials and containers for shipment shall be disregarded in 
determining whether a good is originating.  
  
Article 4.15 
Indirect Materials  
 
An indirect material shall be considered to be  originating without regard to 
where it is produced. 
  
Article 4.16 
Sets of Goods  
 1.  For a set classified as a result of the application of rule 3(a) or rule 3(b) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the originating status of the set shall be determined in accordance with the product -specific rule of 
origin that applies to the set.  
 2.  For a set classified as a result of the application of rule 3(c) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the set shall be originating only if each good in the set is originating and both the set and the goods meet the other applicable requirements of this Chapter. 
 3.  Notwithstanding paragraph 2, for a set classified as a result of the application of rule 3(c) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, the 
set is originating if the value of all the non- originating goods in the set does not 
exceed 20 per cent of the value of the set.  
  4.  For the purposes of paragraph 3, the value of the non- originating goods in the set 
and the value of the set shall be calculated in the same manner as the value of non -
originating materials and the value of the good. 
 
  
Article 4.17  
Non-Alteration   
 
1.  An originating good shall retain its originating status if the good has been 
transported to the importing Party without passing through the territory of a non-party.   
2.  A n originating good transported through the territory of one or more non- parties 
shall  retain its originating status provided that the good :

If unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of rule 2(a) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonized System are imported by more than one shipment, a single declaration of origin for such products may be used on request of the importer and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party. 
  
Article 4.19  
Basis of a Declaration of Origin or Importer’s Knowledge  
 1.  Each Party shall provide that if a producer declares the origin of a good, the declaration of origin is completed on the basis of the producer having information that the good is originating. 
 2.  Each Party shall provide that if the exporter is not the producer of the good, a declaration of origin may be completed by the exporter of the good on the basis of:  
 
(a) the exporter having information that the good is originating; or 
 
(b) reasonable reliance on the producer’s information that the good is originating.  
 
3.  Each Party shall provide that if an importer of the good makes a claim for preferential tariff treatment on the basis of the importer’s knowledge the good is originating,  the claim is made on the basis of:

2.  Each Party shall provide that a producer or exporter in its territory that provides a declaration of origin shall maintain, for a period of four years from the date the declaration of origin was issued, or such longer period as the importing Party specifies, all records necessary to demonstrate that a good for which the exporter or producer provided a declaration of origin is originating.   
 3.  Each Party sha ll provide that an importer, exporter, or producer in its territory may 
choose to maintain the records specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 in any medium that allows for prompt retrieval, including electronic, optical, magnetic, or written form in accordance wi th that Party’s laws and regulations.  
  
Article 4.24  
Verification of Origin  
 Initiating a verification of origin  
 1.  For the purpose of determining whether a good imported into its territory is originating, the customs authority of the importing Party may conduct a verification of any claim for preferential tariff treatment by one or more of the following:  
 (a) a written request for information from the importer of the good; 
 
(b) a written request for information from the exporter or producer of the good, where the customs authority of the importing Party considers the information obtained under subparagraph (a) is not sufficient to make a determination and the customs authority of  the importing Party would like 
additional information; or  
 
(c) a written request for information from the customs authority of the exporting Party where the customs authority of the importing Party considers the information obtained under subparagraph (a)  and 
subparagraph (b) is not sufficient to make a determination and the customs authority of the importing Party would like additional information.  
 A verification under this paragraph may be conducted at the time the customs import declaration  is lodged, or before or after the release of the good by the 
customs authority of the importing Party. 
 2. If the customs authority of the importing Party decides to conduct a verification pursuant to paragraph 1, it shall accept information directly from the import er, 
exporter, or producer.  
  3.  Where a written request is made under subparagraph 1(b) the customs authority of 
the importing Party shall:  
 
(a)  ensure that the information requested is limited to information pertaining to 
the fulfilment of the requirements of this Chapter as follows:   
 
(i) if the claim was based on a declaration of origin, that declaration of origin; and  
 (ii) where the claim was based on the good having been wholly obtained or produced pursuant to subparagraph (a) of Article 4.2 (Origin Criteria), the applicable subparagraph in Article 4.3 (Wholly Obtained or Produced Goods), and the place of production; or 
 
(iii) where the clai m was based on the good having been produced 
entirely pursuant to subparagraph (b) of Article 4.2 (Origin Criteria), information on the origin of the materials, and the place of production; or 
 
(iv) where the claim was based on a change in tariff classification, a list of all the non- originating materials used in the production of the 
good in a Party, including their tariff classification (in two, four, or six-digit format, depending on the relevant product -specific rule of 
origin); or  
 
(v) where the claim  was based on the regional value content, the value 
of the final good, the value of all non- originating materials used in
