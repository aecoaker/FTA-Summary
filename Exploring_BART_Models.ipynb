Without prejudice to its other rights and obligations under the SCM Agreement, prior to initiating a countervailing duty investigation against imports from the other Party, the importing Party shall afford to the other Party a reasonable opportunity to consult with the aim of clarifying the situation on matters raised in the application and arriving at a mutually agreed solution. Any such consultations shall not unnecessarily delay or prevent a Party from proceeding expeditiously to initiate and conduct an investigation. 3. The Parties reaffirm their rights and obligations under Articles 6.2 and 6.3 of the AD Agreement and Article 12.2 of the SCM Agreement, including with respect to the rights of interested parties to present information orally and to defend their interests in the conduct of an anti-dumping investigation or a countervailing duty investigation. 4. Each Party shall ensure, before a final determination is made, full and meaningful disclosure of all essential facts under consideration which form the basis for the decision whether to apply definitive measures in an anti-dumping investigation or a countervailing duty investigation. This is without prejudice to Article 6.5 of the AD Agreement and Article 12.4 of the SCM Agreement. Disclosures shall be made in writing, and allow interested parties sufficient time to defend their interests.'\n",
